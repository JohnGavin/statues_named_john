The `londonremembers` R package provides a robust, transparent, and reproducible framework for acquiring, analyzing, and interactively mapping public statues and memorials in London. Moving beyond a single data source, this package integrates information from multiple authoritative APIs (Wikidata, OpenStreetMap, and Greater London Historic Environment Record) to create a comprehensive, deduplicated dataset. Its core purpose is to enable in-depth analysis of London's commemorative landscape, facilitate the validation of public claims (e.g., regarding gender representation), and offer interactive data exploration.

## Data Sources

This package leverages a robust multi-source data acquisition strategy to build a comprehensive dataset of London's statues and memorials. This approach ensures broader coverage, higher data quality, and improved reproducibility compared to single-source methods.

**Primary Data Sources:**

-   **Wikidata**: Structured linked open data, queried via its SPARQL endpoint. Provides rich metadata on subjects, creators, and precise geographic coordinates.
-   **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**: Community-contributed geographic data, accessed via the Overpass API. Excellent for detailed location information and various memorial tags.
-   **Greater London Historic Environment Record (GLHER)**: Professional heritage data, accessed via CSV exports. Offers authoritative records with high data quality.

**Note on `londonremembers.com`:** While initially a source of interest, direct programmatic access (e.g., web scraping) to `londonremembers.com` proved unfeasible due to its JavaScript-rendered content and lack of a public API. This project thus pivots to the above API-driven sources to ensure reliability and reproducibility.

This multi-source strategy allows for spatial deduplication and intelligent merging of records, creating a unified and enriched dataset for analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JohnGavin/statues_named_john")
```

**Note on Nix Environment:**
This project is developed within a Nix environment to ensure full reproducibility and consistent package management. It is highly recommended to use the provided Nix configuration (`default.nix`) to set up your development environment. This will ensure all necessary R packages (e.g., `WikidataQueryServiceR`, `osmdata`, `sf`, `leaflet`) and system dependencies are correctly installed. Refer to the `default.nix` and `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` for details on setting up and using the Nix shell.

## Features

The `londonremembers` package offers a comprehensive suite of functionalities for exploring London's commemorative landscape:

-   **Multi-Source Data Retrieval**: Seamlessly acquire statue and memorial data from Wikidata, OpenStreetMap, and GLHER APIs.
-   **Data Standardization & Deduplication**: Standardize diverse data formats into a common schema and intelligently deduplicate records based on geographic proximity using spatial algorithms.
-   **Interactive Mapping**: Generate rich interactive Leaflet maps displaying statue locations with detailed pop-ups (name, subject, year, material, sculptor, image, and source links) and marker clustering for optimal visualization.
-   **Gender Analysis**: Analyze the representation of genders among commemorated subjects, enabling critical validation of public claims (e.g., "more statues of men named John than women").
-   **Reproducible Workflow**: Built with reproducibility in mind, leveraging caching, `targets` pipelines, and a transparent methodology.

## Usage

The `londonremembers` package simplifies the process of acquiring, processing, and analyzing statue data. Below are basic examples to get started. For a comprehensive guide, refer to the project vignette.

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(londonremembers)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(leaflet) # For viewing the map

# 1. Retrieve data from multiple sources (with caching)
#    These functions query the respective APIs
wikidata_data <- get_statues_wikidata(location = "Q84", cache_path = "data-raw/wikidata_cache.rds")
osm_data <- get_statues_osm(bbox = c(-0.510375, 51.28676, 0.334015, 51.691874), cache_path = "data-raw/osm_cache.rds")
glher_data <- get_statues_glher(cache_path = "data-raw/glher_cache.rds")

# 2. Standardize data to a common schema
wikidata_std <- standardize_statue_data(wikidata_data, "wikidata")
osm_std <- standardize_statue_data(osm_data, "osm")
glher_std <- standardize_statue_data(glher_data, "glher")

# 3. Combine and deduplicate the data
all_statues <- combine_statue_sources(
  list(wikidata = wikidata_std, osm = osm_std, glher = glher_std),
  distance_threshold = 50 # meters
)

message("Total unique statues identified: ", nrow(all_statues))
# Example: Total unique statues identified: 250

# 4. Perform gender analysis
gender_results <- analyze_by_gender(all_statues)
print(gender_results$summary)
# Example output:
#   inferred_gender     n percent
# 1            Male   180    72.0
# 2          Female    50    20.0
# 3         Unknown    15     6.0
# 4          Animal     5     2.0

# 5. Validate claims (e.g., "more Johns than women")
johns_vs_women <- compare_johns_vs_women(all_statues)
message(johns_vs_women$message)
# Example: Found 20 statues named John (8.0%) vs 50 women statues (20.0%).
message("Claim 'more Johns than women' validated (False if Johns <= Women): ", johns_vs_women$claim_validated)
# Example: Claim 'more Johns than women' validated (False if Johns <= Women): FALSE

# 6. Create an interactive map
statue_map <- map_statues(
  all_statues,
  popup_fields = c("name", "subject", "year_installed", "material"),
  color_by = "source",
  cluster = TRUE
)
statue_map # Display the map in RStudio Viewer or browser
# htmlwidgets::saveWidget(statue_map, "london_statues_map.html") # To save to HTML file
```
